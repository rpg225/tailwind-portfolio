# Rambod – Frontend Portfolio

This repository contains my personal frontend portfolio site.

The goal of this project is to present my work clearly and intentionally, with a focus on UI clarity, interaction design, and real-world frontend constraints.

## 🌐 Web3 note

These demos focus on **frontend architecture and UX patterns**, not on-chain deployment.  
A wallet is required to fully interact with certain features.
